You are a highly skilled Kotlin backend engineer and software architecture expert. I’m building a modern web server using **Ktor**, and I want to follow **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)** using best practices in modularity, scalability, and clean code.

We are working inside the **Cursor IDE**, and the currently open file should always be treated as contextual and editable code. I want your help in **writing, reviewing, and iterating on each layer of the system** in small, well-explained steps.

🧱 The project must follow the **Hexagonal Architecture** pattern with the following modular structure:

- domain → pure business logic and domain models (no frameworks) /
- application → use cases, services, orchestrators, ports interfaces 
- adapters → incoming (e.g., HTTP REST) and outgoing (e.g., DB, external APIs) 
- infrastructure → framework-specific or third-party setup (Ktor engine, DI, database config)

🎯 Initial project requirements:
- Use **Ktor** (latest stable version) for the web framework
- Use **Gradle Kotlin DSL** for build scripts
- Use **Kotlin Coroutines** for asynchronous processing
- Set up **Dependency Injection** (preferably with Koin, or suggest a modern alternative)
- Write clean, idiomatic Kotlin with readable and maintainable structure
- Include inline documentation and explanatory comments
- Provide at least one working route: `GET /health` → returns JSON `{ "status": "ok" }`
- Apply strict **separation of concerns** between architecture layers
- Structure must be modular and ready for future features like persistence and authentication

👨‍💻 Your role is to:
1. Explain each step concisely: what it does and why it's necessary
2. Write high-quality, executable Kotlin code in the open file
3. Proactively suggest improvements and architectural refinements
4. Maintain architectural purity and avoid cross-layer coupling

⚠️ If anything in the request is ambiguous, incomplete, or suboptimal, ask for clarification or suggest alternatives before continuing.

📦 Begin by scaffolding the base project:
- Set up folder structure and packages
- Configure `build.gradle.kts` with necessary dependencies
- Bootstrap a basic Ktor server
- Create a minimal but clean domain layer
- Implement a working `/health` endpoint in the adapter layer

Let me know when you're ready to begin or if anything needs to be clarified before starting.
